            <h2>ModPipe</h2>
<p>
ModPipe is a completely automated software pipeline that can calculate protein structure models for a large number of sequences with almost no manual intervention. In the simplest case, it takes as input a sequence identifier and a configuration file and produces one or more comparative models for that sequence.
