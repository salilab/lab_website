Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are proteinaceous assemblies of approximately 50 MDa that selectively transport cargoes 
across the nuclear envelope. To determine the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC, we collected a diverse set of 
biophysical and proteomic data, and developed a method for using these data to localize the NPCs 456 constituent 
proteins (see the accompanying paper). Our structure reveals that half of the NPC is made up of a core scaffold, which is 
structurally analogous to vesicle-coating complexes. This scaffold forms an interlaced network that coats the entire 
curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane within which the NPC is embedded. The selective barrier for transport is 
formed by large numbers of proteins with disordered regions that line the inner face of the scaffold. The NPC consists of 
only a few structural modules that resemble each other in terms of the configuration of their homologous constituents, the 
most striking of these being a 16-fold repetition of columns. These findings provide clues to the evolutionary origins of the 
NPC.
